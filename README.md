# Super-Mario-63

Source code as of 2010. This project has been converted from Adobe Flash Professional CS4 FLA format to CS6 Uncompressed XFL format.

Feel free to make changes and pull-requests. However be warned: I'm not too sure how compatible the XFL format is with git (you might have a lot of line changes even if you only changed something small). If you make changes, please try to make sure the project can still be opened in Flash Professional CS6.

# Practice hack

This repo contains modifications made as part of the SM63 Practice Hack project. We have moved from modifying an existing binary of the game to recompiling from source because it allows much cleaner and better-written code. For the original game code, see [runouw/Super-Mario-63](https://github.com/runouw/Super-Mario-63).
